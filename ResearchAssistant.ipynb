Instead, the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge) with the goal of maximizing the cumulative reward (the feedback of which might be incomplete or delayed). The search for this balance is known as the exploration–exploitation dilemma.\n",

            "Summary: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a subfield of machine learning that combines principles of reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning. It involves training agents to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards, while using deep neural networks to represent policies, value functions, or environment models. This integration enables DRL systems to process high-dimensional inputs, such as images or continuous control signals, making the approach effective for solving complex tasks. Since the introduction of the deep Q-network (DQN) in 2015, DRL has achieved significant successes across domains including games, robotics, and autonomous systems, and is increasingly applied in areas such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles.\n",

            "Summary: In machine learning, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a technique to align an intelligent agent with human preferences. It involves training a reward model to represent preferences, which can then be used to train other models through reinforcement learning.\n",
            "In classical reinforcement learning, an intelligent agent's goal is to learn a function that guides its behavior, called a policy. This function is iteratively updated to maximize rewards based on the agent's task performance. However, explicitly defining a reward function that accurately approximates human preferences is challenging. Therefore, RLHF seeks to train a \"reward model\" directly from human feedback. The reward model is first trained in a supervised manner to predict if a response to a given prompt is good (high reward) or bad (low reward) based on ranking data collected from human annotators. This model then serves as a reward function to improve an agent's policy through an optimization algorithm like proximal policy optimization.\n",
            "\n",
            "RLHF has applications in various domains in machine learning, including natural language processing tasks such as text summarization and conversational agents, computer vision tasks like text-to-image models, and the development of video game bots. While RLHF is an effective method of training models to act better in accordance with human preferences, it also faces challenges due to the way the human preference data is collected. Though RLHF does not require massive amounts of data to improve performance, sourcing high-quality preference data is still an expensive process. Furthermore, if the data is not carefully collected from a representative sample, the resulting model may exhibit unwanted biases.\n",
